<!-- Goal of the Project -->
## Goals

In this checkpoint, students will demonstrate a working knowledge of building full-stack applications. They will utilize a VueJs frontend with Vue-Router to manage the DOM. On the server side, students will use the DotNet WebApi, implementing the Repository pattern to communicate with the database. In addition, students will use Auth0 for user management, Dapper as an ORM, and a MySQL server for their database.
